Known bugs:

- After completing the trade, vehicle keys aren't sent to the new owner.
- Login buttons sometimes during restarts not being clickable (Had a few windows issues back then, can't prove it was me or smth else)
- The chat is built insinde the Vue Web Application. Sometimes if you spam the chat long enough the last event to unfreeze your character isn't sent.
